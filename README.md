# Orbit PosteriorDB

This github repository will house a number of orbit-fitting problems expressed as Octofitter LogDensity problems.

In the future I will create a proper structure where you can load the model by name, and then fit as desired.

For now, I have included scripts that include defining the model, fitting the model, and plotting the results.
